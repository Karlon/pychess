Description: chess graphical user interface for several chess engines and the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS)
 PyChess is a fully featured, nice looking, and easy to use chess
 client for the GNOME desktop. It is usable both for those totally new
 to chess, as well as advanced users who want to use a computer to
 further enhance their play.
 .
 PyChess has a builtin python chess engine and auto-detects most
 popular chess engines (stockfish, Rybka, Houdini, Shredder, GNU Chess,
 Crafty, Fruit, and many more).  All other engines which aren't
 auto-detected can be manually added through the Engines dialog. Any
 added or detected engine can be configured and fine-tuned in the
 Engines dialog. These engines are available as opponents, and are used
 to provide hints during games (via colored move arrows), to show
 analysis in the Hints panel, and to show scores in the Score panel
 (future). The Hints Panel also shows opening book moves for any
 configured opening books, and end-game analysis using configured
 Gaviota end-game tablebases (both on-disk and on-line). Both the
 opening book and end-game tablebases locations can be configured in
 the Preferences dialog.
 .
 When you get sick of playing computer players you can login to FICS
 and play against people all over the world. You can also observe other
 games being played, create up to three custom seek profiles, browse
 other players on-line and view their profiles, login and resume an
 unfinished game after being disconnected, play any supported chess
 variant, analyze both observed and completed games using any
 configured analyzer, and chat with your opponent and anyone else
 online. PyChess also has a built-in Timeseal client, so you won't lose
 clock time during a game due to lag, and pre-move support, which means
 you can select a piece, start dragging it, or even make a complete
 move before your opponent has made their move (which will then be made
 automatically for you when your opponent completes their move without
 loss of clock time).
 .
